# QAOA and QFI

Here will be the code for our ongoing project on quantum approximate optimization algorithm and quantum Fisher information. For now, we share only some auxiliary code, inculding calculating the effective quantum dimension (see Eq. 8 [here](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040309)).
